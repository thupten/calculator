calc start with 0 on display

when first num key pressed, 0 replaced.
until an operation key is pressed keep adding new keys to the right

when operation key pressed, set operation.
the next key will reset the display and display new key until equal or an operation key is pressed


if operation pressed for the first time, store the current number in temp
when operation key presesd for 2nd or more, calculate the result and store the result in temp



dispValue = 0;
resultValue = undefined;

if buttonPressed is number
   if(previous button was nothing or a number button)
        concatenate to number displayed, we will take care removing the preceding zero with regex.
   else if(previous button was a equal or operation)
        save the displayed number
        clear the display
        write the number on display

if buttonPressed is operation
    if its first time operation pressed
        change operation to operation pressed
    if its not first time operation pressed
        calculate(x,y,operation) the result
        save the result
        display the result

if buttonPressed is equal
    if operation is something
        calculate(x,y,operation)
        save the result
        display the result
    else
        do nothing

if buttonPressed is clear
    empty the result, empty the operation
    change display to 0


---recursively
n = calculate(n, n1, operation);
memory = [{n:'0', n1:'10', operation:'add'},...]
